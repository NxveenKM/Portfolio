Naveen Kumar Meena's Portfolio
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio website. This project serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and professional experience as a Web Developer and UI/UX Designer.

Key Features
Responsive Design: The website is built to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

Modern Aesthetics: It features a clean, dark-themed design with a subtle glassmorphism effect, dynamic hover animations, and a modern color palette.

Interactive Elements: Scroll-triggered animations, smooth transitions, and a dynamic video background in the hero section create an engaging user experience.

Contact Form Integration: The contact form is fully functional and uses Formspree to send messages directly to my email, making it easy for visitors to get in touch.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and content of the website.

CSS3: For all styling, layout, and animations. This includes custom CSS for a unique design without relying on a framework.

JavaScript: For interactivity and dynamic effects, such as the scroll-triggered animations.
